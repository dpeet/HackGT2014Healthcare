TODO / Low Hanging Fruit
------------------------
* Currently events list "Hospital Details" link routes through the MajorEvent Details page. Preferably it would ignore the majordetails if you click on the link
* We should be able to generate a list of major events by tag
* Go through adding each type, make sure initial data is formatted the same as inputted data
* Picklist of states for input
* Picklist of hospitals when adding majorevent
* Picklist of drugs when adding majorevent (only allow picklist values - aka already created drugs)
* Check logic for inputting drugs, to make sure everything [still] works (specifically tags and drugs on majorevent - they got restructured)
* Check logic for inputting majorevents, to make sure everything [still] works (specifically tags and drugs on majorevent - they got restructured)

* Make "Good" and "Bad" labels in drug list



Future Work / Stretch Goals
------------------------
* Set up accounts
* Suggest tags based on current tags
* Ensure Meteor.Accounts is added as a dependency in the repo (might need to push changes from dev's local copy)
* Logic around city/state/zip input, since you shouldn't have to put in all of them
* Change matching tags (when searching) to label-info to show that they are matching
* Navbar color splash
* Inputs seem to come in as text all the time, doesn't seem to break anything


DONE
------------------------
* Rewrite this readme so its not this other persons thing
* Check logic for inputting hospitals, to make sure everything [still] works (specifically tags and drugs on majorevent - they got restructured)
